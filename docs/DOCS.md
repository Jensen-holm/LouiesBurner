# LouiesBurner

A Twitter/X bot system for posting sports statistics and updates for Grand Valley State University athletics. The bot supports multiple sports, scraping game statistics from the GVSU Lakers website and posting detailed game summaries and season highs to Twitter/X.

## Core Components

### Sport Base Class (`sports/sport.py`)
Abstract base class defining the interface for sport-specific implementations:
- `__init__(year: int, sport: str)`: Initialize sport with year and name
- `get_season_highs_for_date()`: Retrieve season highs for a specific date
- `create_tweet_text()`: Generate formatted tweet content
- Abstract methods for sport-specific logic

Function Relationships:
- `get_season_highs_for_date()` depends on sport-specific implementations of abstract methods for data processing
- `create_tweet_text()` utilizes the data gathered by `get_season_highs_for_date()` to format the output
- Both methods rely on utility functions from `utils.py` for common operations

### Sport Implementations
Each sport (Baseball, Softball) extends the Sport base class with specific implementations for:
- Date extraction from opponent strings
- Tweet text generation
- Season high statistics processing
- Sport-specific verbs and statistics

Function Relationships:
- Sport-specific implementations override abstract methods from the base Sport class
- These implementations interact with `scraping.py` functions to gather game data
- Tweet generation methods coordinate with `x.py` for posting to Twitter/X
- All sport implementations use common utilities from `utils.py`

### Workflow Schedule Generation (`scripts/generate_game_schedules.py`)
Generates GitHub Actions workflow files based on game schedules:
- Parses CSV schedule files
- Generates cron expressions for automated checks
- Creates sport-specific workflow YAML files

Function Relationships:
- Schedule parsing functions work with CSV files in the schedules/ directory
- Generated workflows interact with `main.py` for execution
- Uses utility functions from `utils.py` for date handling and file operations

### Main Script (`main.py`)
Core execution script supporting multiple sports:
- Command-line interface for sport selection
- Season highs processing and tweet generation
- Retry mechanism for failed tweet attempts
- Grouping of achievements by player

Function Relationships:
- Coordinates between sport implementations and Twitter/X posting functionality
- Uses schedule handling from `schedule.py` to determine game dates
- Integrates with `x.py` for social media posting
- Leverages utility functions from `utils.py` for common operations

## GitHub Actions Workflows

The project uses dynamically generated workflows for each sport, created by `generate_game_schedules.py`. Each workflow:

- Runs automatically based on game schedule
- Can be manually triggered
- Checks for season highs from the previous day's games
- Posts achievements to Twitter/X

### Required Secrets
Configure these secrets in your GitHub repository:
- `CLIENT_ID`
- `CLIENT_SECRET`
- `BEARER_TOKEN`
- `ACCESS_TOKEN`
- `ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET`
- `CONSUMER_KEY`
- `CONSUMER_SECRET`

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Jensen-holm/LouiesBurner
    ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Configure Twitter/X API credentials as environment variables
4. Generate workflow files:
   ```bash
   python scripts/generate_game_schedules.py
   ```

## Usage

### Local Execution
Run the main script with specific sport and date:
```bash
python main.py -sport baseball -date 2024-03-15
```

Available arguments:
- `-sport`: Sport to process (choices: baseball, softball)
- `-date`: Date to check in ISO format (YYYY-MM-DD)

### GitHub Actions
1. Automatic execution based on game schedules
2. Manual trigger:
   - Navigate to Actions tab
   - Select sport-specific workflow
   - Click "Run workflow"

## Output Format

The bot generates sport-specific tweets containing:
- Player name
- Achievement date
- Season high statistics
- Sport-specific formatting

Example baseball tweet:
```
💪 BEAST MODE: K. Nott 💪
Dominates with 3.0 walks against Indianapolis! #AnchorUp ⚓️
```

## Dependencies
- beautifulsoup4: Web scraping
- requests: HTTP requests
- tweepy: Twitter/X API integration
- pandas: Data processing
- pyyaml: Workflow file generation

## Testing

Run the test suite:
```bash
python -m pytest tests/
```

Tests cover:
- Schedule parsing
- Date handling
- Sport-specific implementations
- Tweet text generation
